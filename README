XML::Filter::Reindent version 0.03
==================================

DESCRIPTION

XML::Filter::Reindent is a sub class of XML::Filter::DetectWS. 

XML::Filter::Reindent can be used as a PerlSAX filter to reformat an XML document before sending it to a PerlSAX
handler that prints it (like XML::Handler::Composer.) 

Like XML::Filter::DetectWS, it detects ignorable whitespace and blocks of whitespace characters in certain places. It
uses this information and information supplied by the user to determine where whitespace may be modified, deleted or
inserted. Based on the indent settings, it then modifies, inserts and deletes characters and ignorable_whitespace
events accordingly. 

This is just a first stab at the implementation. It may be buggy and may change completely!
